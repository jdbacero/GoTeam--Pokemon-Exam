# Usage

## Run npm and composer
Before we start, we need the latest Composer and a relatively updated NPM. Then, install all PHP and Node packages.
```
npm install
composer install
```

## Setup the .env file

Copy the __.env.example__ file and edit the fields according to your MySQL setup:
 1. DB_CONNECTION
 2. DB_HOST
 3. DB_PORT
 4. DB_DATABASE
 5. DB_USERNAME
 6. DB_PASSWORD

## Run the DB Migrations
```
php run migrate

You can also add `--seed` to the command so that you can run the default DB seeders.

## Generate new key
Make sure you generate a new key for the application 
`php artisan key:generate`

Run the command `npm run dev` so that Vite will run. Afterwards, run the project with the command `php artisan serve` and you should be given the link to access the project in your terminal.
